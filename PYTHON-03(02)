answer
name = input()
m1 = int(input())
m2 = int(input())
m3 = int(input())
m4 = int(input())
m5 = int(input())

total = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 + m5
average = total / 5
print(f"Name of the Student:{name}")
print(f"Total Mark:{total}")
print(f"Average Mark:{average}")
average=int(average)
if average == 100:
    grade = "S"
elif 90 <= average <= 99:
    grade = "A"
elif 80 <= average <= 89:
