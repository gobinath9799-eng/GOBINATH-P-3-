ANSWER
# Program to find the greatest of three numbers


n1 = int(input())
n2 = int(input())
n3 = int(input())

if n3 >= n1 and n3 >= n2:
    print(f"Number3 is maximum with value of {float(n3)}")
elif n2 >= n1 and n2 >= n3:
    print(f"Number2 is maximum with value of {float(n2)}")
else:
    print(f"Number1 is maximum with value of {float(n1)}")
