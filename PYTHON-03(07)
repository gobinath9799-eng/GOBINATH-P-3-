Kumar wants to learn how the calculators are working.so he is trying to implements the calculator program.could you please help him to implements the program. - Notes:- Must use the Switch Case.operators - Addition - Subtraction - Multiplication - Division - Modulo

Input Format

First input consists of integer.
Second input consists of integer.
third input consists of character.
Constraints

ANSWER

 Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
2
a = int(input())
3
b = int(input())
4
op = input()
5
match op:
6
    case '+':
7
        print(f"Addition of two number is {float(a + b)}")
8
    case '-':
9
        print(f"Subtraction of two number is {float(a - b)}")
10
    case '*':
11
        print(f"Multiplication of two number is {float(a * b)}")
12
    case '/':
13
        print(f"Division of two number is {float(a / b)}")
14
    case '%':
15
        print(f"Modulo of two number is {float(a % b)}")
16
    case _:
17
        print("Invalid Input")
